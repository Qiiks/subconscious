#!/bin/bash
# Restart the launchd-managed subc daemon onto the binary already placed at its
# path, and do not return until a NEW daemon is running and serving.
#
# Why this exists: the old one-liner was `launchctl bootout …; sleep 2;
# launchctl bootstrap …`. That only worked while the outgoing daemon exited
# within 2 s. Since the daemon waits for each module's own shutdown (up to 25 s
# before it signals a module), bootout can still be waiting when bootstrap runs;
# bootstrap then fails with "Input/output error" because the job is still loaded,
# nothing retries, and the whole fleet stays down until someone notices. That is
# what happened on 2026-09-24 at 07:19Z: 4 minutes dark, ended by the operator.
#
# So this script waits for the old job to be gone, retries bootstrap, and only
# reports success after reading a new pid and the new daemon's start line.
# Run it detached (it cuts the lanes an agent's shell may depend on) and read its
# log afterwards:  nohup scripts/fleet/cut-daemon.sh >/tmp/cut.log 2>&1 &
