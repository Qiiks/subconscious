# Check COMMITTED Cargo.lock validity for fleet repos that path-depend on
# commons or subconscious.
#
# Mechanism this surfaces: path dependencies record the version read from the
# path, so a version bump in an upstream repo invalidates the committed lock of
# every sibling — with zero changes in the sibling's own tree and no signal to
# its owner. Local builds keep passing because any unlocked cargo command
# quietly repairs the WORKING-TREE lock; only a clean checkout (CI) fails.
#
# Instrument note, learned by running the first version: a git-archive-to-temp
# probe CANNOT judge these repos (the archive lacks sibling path-dep targets
# and, for some repos, workspace members — the probe's own failure then reads
# as a stale lock; 13 false positives out of 16 on first run). The honest
# read-only form is two-armed, in place:
#   lock CLEAN in tree  -> in-place `cargo metadata --locked` judges the
#                          committed lock exactly (same bytes).
#   lock DIRTY in tree  -> cannot judge the committed lock without mutating
#                          the owner's tree; reported as its own state, which
#                          is itself the owner signal (a dirty lock means an
#                          unlocked command already repaired the working tree
#                          — the committed lock is almost certainly stale).
#
# Upstream arm: a version bump WRITTEN to a path-dep crate's Cargo.toml is
# fleet-visible the moment it is on disk — every consumer's cargo call records
# the working-tree version, which resolves locally and fails their CI (the
# committed ref does not have it). So an uncommitted bump in an upstream tree
# is itself a fleet exposure, reported here so the bump's author sees the
# window they are holding open. Absent at the committed ref means: commit and
# push it now, or revert it.
#
# Exit: 0 all clean locks resolve and no uncommitted upstream bumps; 1 stale,
# dirty, or uncommitted bump found; 2 vacuity floor.

# It was a hardcoded 16-name array until 2026-09-18, and it was wrong in both
# directions: it MISSED alfonso-tui, which path-deps subc-client-rs and
# subc-protocol from its root manifest and had therefore never had a lock
# checked; and it LISTED aft and thalamus, which consume no path deps at all
# (thalamus pins subc by git rev, so a bump here cannot reach it until it
# repins). Neither error was visible from the script's output: it reported
# "examined 16 path-dependent repos" whether or not the seventeenth existed.
#
# A hardcoded list is A CLAIM ABOUT ANOTHER FILE, and this guard cannot tell you
# when that claim expires -- which is the same defect one layer up from the one
# it exists to catch (FUSI, who hit it building the mirror of this check).

# Discovery reads the fleet convention: root manifest plus crates/*/Cargo.toml,

# origin pointing inside $ROOT, so a scratch copy of a seat is not counted as a
