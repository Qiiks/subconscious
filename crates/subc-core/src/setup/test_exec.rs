//! Test fixtures that place a file a test is about to execute.
//!
//! The test binary runs tests on many threads, and any of them may `fork()`
//! for a `Command::spawn` at any moment. A child forked while this process
//! holds a writable descriptor on a file inherits that descriptor until the
//! child reaches `execve` (only then does `O_CLOEXEC` close it). If a test
//! executes the file inside that window, the kernel still sees the file open
//! for writing and refuses with `ETXTBSY` ("Text file busy"); renaming the
//! file first does not help, because the inherited descriptor refers to the
//! same inode. The helpers below therefore never open the file for writing in
//! this process: a short-lived child does the writing, so the writable
//! descriptor exists only in that child and is closed when it exits.
